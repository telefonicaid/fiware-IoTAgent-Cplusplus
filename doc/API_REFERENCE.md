# IoT Agent Provision API Documentacion
The IoT Agent Provision API is based on REST principles. This documentation covers the resources you can manipulate on IoT Agent in order to publish custom information in IoT Platform.

**Allowed HTTPs requests:**

- POST: Creates a resource or list of resources.
- PUT: Updates a resource.
- GET: Retrieves a resource or list of resources.
- DELETE: Delete a resource.

**Typical Server Responses:**

- 200 OK: The request was succesful (some API calls may return 201 instead).
- 201 Created: The request was succesful and a resource or list of resources was created.
- 204 No Content: The request was succesful but there is no representation to return (that is, the response is empty).
- 400 Bad Request: The request could not be understood or was missing required parameters.
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication failed.
- 403 Forbidden: Access denied.
- 404 Not Found: Resource was not found.
- 409 Conflict: A resource cannot be created because it already exists.
- 500 Internal Server Error: Generic error when server has a malfunction. This error will be removed.

Responses related with authentication and authorization depends on this feature is configured and a Keystone OpenStack sytem is present.

When an error is returned, a representation is returned as:

```
{
  "reason": "contains why an error is returned",
  "details": "contains specific information about the error, if possible"
}
```

## Authentication and Authorization
If IoT Agent is in authenticated environment, this API requires a token, which you obtain from authentication system. This system and its API is out of scope of present documentation. In this environment, a mandatory header is needed: `X-Auth-Token`.

## Mandatory HTTP Headers
Anyway, this API needs two headers in order to manage requests:
- `Fiware-Service` : Represents a tenant, the higher level in resources hierachy in IoT Platform environment. If this header is not present an error is returned.
- `Fiware-ServicePath` : Represents the second level. Its value must be start by character '/'. If this header is not present we assume '/'. There are operations that is allowed '/*'.

## API Access
All URIs are relative to an specific url, where IoT Agent is raised. For example, `http://127.0.0.1:8080/iot/`.

## Services [/services{?limit,offset,resource,apikey,device}]
Services are the higher level in IoT Platform. When you manipulate a service, you use a Fiware-Service header with its name. Parameters apply to different operations.

### Service Model
Fields in JSON object representing a service are:
- `apikey` (string, mandatory). It is a key used for devices belonging to this service. If "", service does not use apikey, but it must be specified.
- `token` (string, optional). If authentication/authorization system is configured, IoT Agent works as user when it publishes information. That token allows that other components to verify the identity of IoT Agent. Depends on authentication and authorization system.
- `cbroker`(string, mandatory). Context Broker endpoint assigned to this service, it must be a real uri.
- `outgoing_route`(string, optional). It is an identifier for VPN/GRE tunnel. It is used when device is into a VPN and a command is sent.
- `resource` (string, mandatory). Path in IoTAgent. When protocol is HTTP a device could send information to this uri. In general, it is a uri in a HTTP server needed to load and execute a module.
- `entity_type` (string, optional). Entity type used in entity publication (overload default).
- `attributes` (optional, array). Mapping for protocol parameters to entity attributes.
`object_id` (string, mandatory): protocol parameter to be mapped.
`name` (string, mandatory): attribute name to publish.
`type`: (string, mandatory): attribute type to publish.
- `static_attributes` (optional, array). Attributes published as defined.
`name` (string, mandatory): attribute name to publish.
`type` (string, mandatory): attribute type to publish.
`value` (string, mandatory): attribute value to publish.

`static_attributes` and `attributes` are used if device has not this information.
