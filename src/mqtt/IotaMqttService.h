 @name IotaMqttService
 @brief This interface abstracts the service for interacting with the
 ContextBroker in the MQTT realm.
 In other words, this is all what MQTT protocol needs when interacting with CB,
 like publishing MQTT measures
 or receiving requests  or responses to commands. Some of those functions aren't
 offered by this service directly
 but by others referenced here.
 This class can do some basic operations with the information coming from the
 caller @see handle_mqtt_message,
 like checking if the mqtt message is a measure, a command request,or a response
 to a command.
 Based on that, it will call one of its virtual methods.

  @brief This method is the entrypoint for MQTT inner layer calls (caller is
  ESP)
  whenever an MQTT message arrives. There are four pieces of relevant
  information: apikey,
  device id and type are extracted from "topic" and payload from the message
  itself. There
  are three scenarios that are dealt with depending on the type:
  - cmdexe: This is the response for a MQTT command.
  - mul20: this is the multi-measure scenario.
  - any other type (distinct to "cmd"): will be considered as single mesaure
  where "type" is
  the name of the attribute and payload is the value.

  "cmd" type is also received as an echo from the MQTT broker, but this message
  comes from us
  (it represents an MQTT command to the device), so in this case is just
  ignored.
  @param apikey:
  @param idDevice:
  @param payload:
  @param type:

  @return the result of the call of this method should be the publication on
  ContextBroker of the
  Entity (in one or several UpdateContext).
